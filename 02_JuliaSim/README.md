# JuliaSim

JuliaSim is a next generation cloud-based simulation platform, combining the latest techniques in Scientific Machine Learning with equation-based digital twin modeling and simulation.

## What is JuliaSim?

In short, Scientific Machine Learning for Enterprise.
Building upon the foundations of the SciML ecosystem, JuliaSim offers convenient interfaces so that all engineers can inject machine learning into their workflows.

## Getting Started

First, learn the basics of the acausal framework, ModelingToolkit.

# JuliaSim

> JuliaSim is a next generation cloud-based simulation platform, combining the
> latest techniques in Scientific Machine Learning with equation-based digital
> twin modeling and simulation. Powered by JuliaHub.

In short, JuliaSim is Scientific Machine Learning for Enterprise engineers.
Building upon the foundations of the SciML ecosystem, JuliaSim offers convenient
interfaces so that all engineers can inject machine learning into their workflows.

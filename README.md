# JuliaSim Training

JuliaSim is the simulation and modeling platform built upon the JuliaHub platform.
This section walks through the first steps toward using JuliaSim's advanced modeling tools.

## What is JuliaSim

JuliaSim is a next generation cloud-based simulation platform, combining the latest techniques in Scientific Machine Learning with equation-based digital twin modeling and simulation.
